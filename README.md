# Weather-App by alstonf

### Description:

A weather app which shows the current weather of the city entered. The UI is beautifully designed and there a few animations too. Lemme know what you think about this website-cum-app using the feedback option in the bottom left.🌨 ☀️ 💨

And yeah don't forget to leave feedback at the bottom of the page!

### Note that this works best with chromium based browsers or Safari!
